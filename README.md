### Intro
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the basics of UI design, let users enter values, select from options, and the basics of SwiftUI. 

### Challenges
- [ ] Add a header to the third section, saying "Amount per person"
- [ ] Add another section showing the total amount for the check -i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people
- [ ] Change the "Number of people" picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type
